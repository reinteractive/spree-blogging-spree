SpreeBloggingSpree
==================

This fork differs significantly from the original, it started out as a newly generated extension for Spree 1.2 with the logic copied over and tests moved to RSpec. Then updated to spree 3.3, and customized heavily for Sterling parts.

A basic blogging solution for use with the [Spree](http://github.com/spree/spree/) E-Commerce platform.

The blog is found under /blog on the website font end. Blog entries have fields for title, body, summary and date published. Each blog entry can also have categories and tags associated with it.

The [Spree Editor](http://github.com/spree/spree_editor/) extension can be used to provide a rich text experience when editing the body of a blog entry.

Admin users can preview blog entries before they're made publicly visible.
